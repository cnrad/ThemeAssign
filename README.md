# ThemeAssign
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

üìù _Small side project to make WebAssign actually look decent._

__TO-DO__

- Make window for extension, allow theme selector
- Find a better way to inject themes(?)
  - Self-note: Possibly pre-defined .css files with same classnames, !important (or another way to inject)? Look into it
- Style other pages, such as assignments/home
- Create for Chrome/Firefox, upload to stores on both. Release!

## Possible themes

- Default (Light Theme)
- Night (Dark Theme)
- Synthwave '84 name tbd (Neon/Glow theme, retro)
- Simple (simple color scheme, focus on making the UI itself look better aside from colors)
